# pytest-experiments

Hello and welcome to pytest-experiments, the repo in which you will learn how to use pytest.

## Directory structure

First, let us start by explaining the top level of the package.

There is a file called ```gitignore```, this file is particularly useful for listing the names or name-patterns of files that will be found in work-trees when working with your project, but that should not be committed to the project. In other words, it's not OS-specific, it's project-specific.

Then there is a ```setup.py``` file which is used for setting up the package. This is useful to create a plugin out of your repository and make it instalable by others.
