# TESTS

Hello and welcome to the test folder, here is where all the tests testing this plugin will be located.

## test configuration

The ```conftest.py``` is a file that attempts to configure the tests and the way they are run.

This file usually contains ```Fixtures``` which are special functions that pytest runs before and/or after the test functions. The file is also likely to have ```Hooks``` which are another set of special functions that allow you to change how pytest works.
